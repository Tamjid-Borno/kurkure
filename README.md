# You gotta remember this project aint accurately checks your health. This project is just a presentation of my skills on Programming Logic, Python Skills and Data Handling.

What is happening in this project? :- <br>
 -It asks you some questions, (input) <br>
 -Your answers are being saved in the "data.txt" file. <br>
 -It reads the data.txt file <br>
 -then from the answers it calcuated your health percentage ( I have added your answer's value that's why most of your answers would be in Yes or no) <br>
 -Then it gives you the result from "result.txt"  <br>
